# GPTClock - ChatGPT Timestamp Extension

A browser extension that automatically prepends timestamps to both user messages and AI responses in ChatGPT conversations, ensuring temporal context is always included.

## Features

- **Dual Timestamp Injection**: Timestamps both your messages and ChatGPT's responses
- **ISO 8601 Format**: `[2025-10-01T12:34:56.789Z]` for machine readability
- **Human-Readable Time**: `(8:30 PM EST)` appended for easy reading
- **Configurable Time Zone**: Choose between local time or any of 18 specific time zones worldwide
- **Settings UI**: Easy-to-use popup interface with live timestamp preview
- **Line Break**: Timestamps appear on their own line for clean formatting
- **API-Level Interception**: Works by intercepting fetch calls, not DOM manipulation
- **Non-intrusive**: Runs silently in the background
- **Compatible**: Works with chatgpt.com and chat.openai.com

## Usage

1. Navigate to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) or [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)

2. Type your message as normal

3. Press Enter or click the send button

4. The extension automatically prepends timestamps to both your messages and AI responses

Example:
```
Your input: "What's the weather like?"

Sent to ChatGPT:
[2025-10-01T15:30:45.123Z] (3:30 PM EST)
What's the weather like?

ChatGPT's response:
[2025-10-01T15:30:47.456Z] (3:30 PM EST)
I don't have access to real-time weather data...
```

## Configuration

### Accessing Settings

Click the GPTClock extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the settings popup.

### Time Zone Options

The extension offers two time zone modes:

1. **Use Local Time** (default): Automatically uses your computer's local time zone
2. **Specific Time Zone**: Choose from 18 major time zones:
   - **US Time Zones**: Eastern (ET), Central (CT), Mountain (MT), Pacific (PT), Alaska (AKT), Hawaii (HT)
   - **European Time Zones**: London (GMT/BST), Paris (CET/CEST), Berlin (CET/CEST), Moscow (MSK)
   - **Asian Time Zones**: Dubai (GST), India (IST), China (CST), Tokyo (JST), Seoul (KST)
   - **Oceania Time Zones**: Sydney (AEDT/AEST), Auckland (NZDT/NZST)
   - **UTC**: Coordinated Universal Time

### Live Preview

The settings popup includes a live preview that updates every second, showing exactly how timestamps will appear in your ChatGPT conversations with your current configuration.

### Automatic Saving

All settings changes are saved automatically and apply immediately to new messages. No need to refresh the ChatGPT page.

## How It Works

The extension uses a two-script injection pattern to intercept ChatGPT's API communication:

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`): Injects the interceptor script into the page context

2. **Injected Script** (`injected.js`): Runs in the page context to intercept `fetch()` API calls

3. **User Message Interception**: Modifies outgoing requests to ChatGPT's API, prepending timestamps to the `content.parts[]` array in user messages

4. **AI Response Interception**: Intercepts Server-Sent Event (SSE) streaming responses and injects timestamps into the first text delta (`{"v": "text"}`)

This approach works at the API level rather than DOM manipulation, ensuring compatibility even as ChatGPT's interface changes.

## Privacy

- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- No data collection or tracking
- Open source - inspect the code yourself

## Icons

The extension includes custom icons (black background with teal analog clock):
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

SVG source files are also included if you want to customize the design. Use `generate-icons.html` to convert SVG to PNG.

## Troubleshooting

**Timestamps not appearing?**
- Refresh the ChatGPT page after installing the extension
- Check that the extension is enabled in your browser's extension manager
- Open browser console (F12) and look for "GPTClock v2.0.0: Injected script loaded" message
- Verify you see "GPTClock: Timestamp added to outgoing message" when sending messages

**Extension not loading?**
- Ensure all files are in the same folder (`manifest.json`, `content.js`, `injected.js`, icon files)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome/Edge/Brave) or Firefox
- Try completely removing and reinstalling the extension

**Extension updates not loading?**
- Chrome aggressively caches extension files
- Click "Reload" on the extension card in chrome://extensions/
- If that doesn't work, completely remove and reinstall the extension
- Close and reopen your browser

## Uninstallation

1. Navigate to your browser's extensions page
2. Find "GPTClock - ChatGPT Timestamp"
3. Click "Remove"
